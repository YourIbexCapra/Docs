### Severity Scale

| Severity | CVSS V3 Score Range | Definition |
| :-------- | :-------------------- | :------------ |
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Exploitation is straightforward and usually results in system-level compromise. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch immediately. |
| High  | 7.0 - 8.9  | Exploitation is more difficult but could cause elevated privileges and potentially loss of data or downtime. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch as soon as possible. |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Vulnerability exists but are not exploitable or require extra steps such as social engineering. It is advised to form a plan of action and patch after high-priority issues have been resolved. |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Vulnerabilities are non-exploitable but would reduce an organization's attack surface. It is advised to form a plan of action and path during the next maintenance window. |
| Informational | N/A | No vulnerability exists. Additional information is provided regarding items noticed during testing, strong controls, and additional documentation. |
